## Code Validation

### HTML Validation
[W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/), provided by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), is a tool to check HTML code for adherence to web standards. It highlights syntax errors, incorrect tag use, and other issues that might affect the integrity and semantics of your web pages. Employing this validation service ensures your HTML is robust and aligns with web standards.

For validation, HTML pages were extracted from the web application's templates using the Google Chrome browser's 'Inspect' feature and then checked with W3C Validator.

This project incorporates "Summernote," a rich text editor, to facilitate user-generated HTML content for creating and updating posts. While Summernote enriches user interaction, it adds complexity to HTML code validation.

The flexibility afforded by Summernote in HTML content creation can result in non-standard HTML structures or attributes. These atypical elements are often flagged as errors in external validation tools like W3C Validator.

To balance the functionality of Summernote with application security, specific precautions are taken. For instance, the |safe filter in Django forms is used to prevent user-entered HTML from posing security risks to the application, safeguarding against potential threats and attacks.

### CSS Validation
[W3C Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) is a tool provided by W3C that allows you to validate and check the correctness of your CSS code. It helps ensure that your web pages comply with the standards set by the W3C, promoting interoperability and accessibility.

### Python Validaton 
[PEP 8](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) serves as a comprehensive style guide for writing Python code, emphasizing consistency and readability as its core principles. It offers guidance on code formatting, variable and function naming conventions, and various best practices. Adhering to PEP 8 principles contributes to enhancing code quality, making it more readable and maintainable.

## Accessibility

### **Wave**

[The WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) was used to assess the accessibility of the website. WAVE helps identify potential accessibility issues and provides guidance on how to improve the accessibility of web content.

During the evaluation, the following issue was identified:

- **Contrast Warning**: The primary button's color scheme triggered a contrast warning during accessibility evaluation. However, upon thorough review and considering the overall aesthetic and user experience of the site, it has been determined that the current contrast level is sufficient. This decision was made with a careful balance between design integrity and usability in mind, ensuring that the button remains visually distinctive and functionally accessible for most users.

## Performance
I conducted a comprehensive evaluation of [The culture club website](https://) using [Google Lighthouse in Google Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/). This evaluation was performed in Google Chrome browser's incognito mode to eliminate all potential impacts from other addons and cached files.

Several pages, including index.html, post_detail.html that contain larger amount of images, are impacted in performance scores due to our reliance on Cloudinary for image hosting and management. Cloudinary allows users to upload images, providing a dynamic and user-driven experience. However, this flexibility comes with certain trade-offs that affect the Lighthouse performance metrics:

Next-Gen Formats: Cloudinary serves images in formats that may not be the latest 'next-gen' formats recommended by Lighthouse, like WebP, due to broader compatibility considerations.

Image Sizing: Users can upload images of various dimensions, which may not always match the size in which they are displayed, leading to Lighthouse flagging issues with properly sizing images.

Encoding: The encoding settings on Cloudinary are optimized for a balance between quality and performance. While this works well in most cases, Lighthouse may suggest further optimizations that could reduce image fidelity.

Render-Blocking Resources: Some Cloudinary resources are loaded synchronously, which can be flagged by Lighthouse as render-blocking, but are necessary for displaying user content as intended.

These items stem from the inherent trade-offs between user control and automated optimization. While some improvements can be made, such as using Cloudinary's automatic format selection and responsive image capabilities, the nature of user-generated content means that perfect scores in these areas are challenging to achieve without compromising on the user experience.

The performance scores were assessed for both desktop and mobile devices. Below are the summarized results:

### Desktop Performance

- The average performance score across all the desktop pages assessed in the Lighthouse performance tests is approximately 90.07 out of 100.

## Automated Testing

<!-- Automated testing was a critical phase conducted towards the end of the project to gain a deeper understanding of automated testing practices and to uncover any hidden bugs or errors that might have slipped through. This phase focused on testing the essential components and functionalities of the project, with a particular emphasis on the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and various URL patterns and view paths.

If more time was existing in this project, I would also create tests for all user stories.


I created a folder called "tests" inside of my blog application.
In this folder I created three separate files, each corresponding to a specific aspect of the project that needed testing. 
For conducting the tests, I leveraged Django's built-in testing framework and used the `django.test.TestCase` class as the foundation. This framework provides a robust and standardized environment for writing and executing tests, making it easier to assess the project's functionality and reliability.

Before the testing process, it was needed to configure the project's settings in the "settings.py" file in order for the automated testing to work properly. I added this two condition, 1 variable and 1 import statement. This was removed from settings.py when uploading the project to production in heroku for keeping the production settings separate from testing settings. -->

- `import sys`
- `TEST_APPS = ['blog.tests']` 
- `if 'test' in sys.argv or 'test_coverage' in sys.argv:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
        }
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(
            os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')
        )
    }`

- ### test_models.py
  See second test in image below.

- ### test_urls.py
  See third test in image below.

![screenshot](docs/test.md/automated_tests/tests_terminal.png)

To measure code coverage and assess how much of the project's codebase is tested, I used the Coverage.py tool. Here are the steps to view the coverage report in HTML format:

Installing the Coverage.py using pip
- `Pip install coverage`

To check coverage in the HTML format run in the terminal:

- `coverage run --source='.' manage.py test`
  - This will create a `.coverage` file in your root directory
- `coverage html`
  - This will create a folder in your root directory called `htmlcov`
  - Right-click on it and select "Open with Live Server" to view the detailed coverage report.


My tests have achieved 97% code coverage.

**Feedback from testers**

Provided feedback and reported any issues or improvements they encountered during the testing process. Below is the feedback/issues reported.

Certainly! Here's a table with the columns you requested:

| Feature | Feedback | Solution | Result | Fixed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 'Music Albums' category button | Button is not targeted with the css that makes it darker and looked pressed down when active. | This seems to be because of the space between the two words in the category. Therefore a '+' between the words in the html template and <{% if request.GET.category == 'Music Albums' %}active{% endif %}"> had to be implemented to fix the issue. | The button works as it should, changing color to a darker shade when active. | ✅ |
| Summernote blog content editor | The text container is not responsive an leaks out to the right of the container on screens smaller than large.| Summernote seems to have a default fixed with. Feedback was given with a known solution on how to change the fixed width with some additional code in settings.py: SUMMERNOTE_CONFIG = {"summernote": {"width": "100%",},} | The text field container is now responsive to smaller screens | ✅ |
| User Profile fields | If, by any chance, the user chooses to have a username that is unusually long (no white spaces), the username will overflow its container and be displayed out to the right. Same happens to the fields below. | After trying many options to target the field with text-wrap css class and limit characters with failure, and considering making big changes to the models, I came to the conclusion that it is in this stage not prioritized. If the fields contain white spaces (which it does after every word), the line breaks and the content looks nice in the user profiles. The unlikelihood of a user choosing to have a user name that causes this issue is why this is going to have to be considered working on in a later stage. | The text will overflow, but has been removed by admin | ❌ |
