# Database
When creating the database structure schema for this project, I utilized the [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/) website. This online tool allowed me to visually design and document the database schema, making it easier to plan and implement the database for the blog application.

<center> 

![Database Schema image](/docs/readme/database_schema.png) 

</center>

## Database Schema Summary

### `User` Table
- Represents the basic user information according to Django's built-in User model.
- Fields: `username`, `email`, `password`.

### `UserProfile` Table
- Extends the User model to store additional information and personal preferences.
- Fields: `user_profile_id`, `user_id`, `profile_image`, `bio`, `country`, `top_movies`, `top_series`, `top_music_albums`, `top_books`, `top_podcasts`, `top_miscellaneous`.

### `MediaCategory` Table
- Stores the different categories for media types that users can select when creating a blog post.
- Fields: `media_category_id`, `media_name`.

### `BlogPost` Table
- Stores individual blog posts written by users, with details about the media being discussed.
- Fields: `blogpost_id`, `blog_title`, `slug`, `author_id`, `created_on`, `updated_on`, `content`, `excerpt`, `status`, `featured_image`, `media_category_id`, `release_year`, `media_link`, `likes`, `bookmarks`.

### `Comment` Table

# Design

The design of Culture Club is crafted with a blend of nostalgia and modernity, reflecting the essence of cultural appreciation that spans generations. The choices in colors, fonts, and layout are intended to evoke a sense of familiarity and warmth, welcoming users to a community where culture in all its forms is cherished and discussed.

### Design Choices

Design choices were made with the intention of creating an inviting and user-friendly interface that also resonates with the theme of cultural nostalgia. The darker theme breaks from the contemporary trend of minimalistic and bright designs, offering a unique visual experience that aligns with the interests of culture enthusiasts who often have a fondness for timeless classics in movies, music, books, and more.

### Color

In creating balanced interfaces that are both visually appealing and functional, we carefully selected a color palette that complements the overall theme of the site.

![Color Palette image](/workspace/Culture-Club/docs/readme/colorpalette.png)

**Dominant:**

The choice of 'Gunmetal' Green, represented by #012326, as the dominant color, reflects the depth and richness of cultural history. This dark green hue sets a strong foundation for the site's design, providing a serene and focused backdrop for content exploration.

**Secondary:**

'Munsell Blue', represented by #0794A7, serves as the secondary color. This choice is a nod to the vibrancy and dynamism of the cultural sphere. It not only complements the darker green but also adds a splash of energy and modern flair to the design.

**Accent:**

Our accent color is a carefully chosen shade of 'Burnt Orange', represented by #B9581B. This color provides a striking contrast to the greens and blue, drawing attention to important elements like buttons and calls to action. It brings a sense of excitement and highlights the interactive aspects of the site.

**Other colors:**
A softer shade of yellow 'Flax, represented by #E2DA83, used for inline links and smaller elements, adds a subtle yet effective highlight, ensuring that navigation elements are easily identifiable.

Instead of regular white text color, a bit more "greenbluish" shade of white called 'Light Cyan'represented by #CBEAF1, were chosen to blend well with all colors, yet still have great contrast. 

### Fonts

For the Culture Club site, we selected fonts that harmonize with our theme of blending the nostalgic with the contemporary. The H1 headers feature a distinctive font, 'Russo One', that resonates with the nostalgic 80-90's aspect of the site, while the classic Roboto font is used for the body text, ensuring readability and a modern touch. This combination of fonts not only enhances the aesthetic appeal but also contributes to an enjoyable user experience.

### Structure

The Culture Club website is designed with a user-friendly structure, ensuring seamless navigation and easy access to the website's diverse content about movies, music, books, podcasts, and more. Below is an overview of the website's structure:

#### Before User Logs In:

- **Landing Page with Sign In Form:** Upon arrival, users are greeted by a visually engaging landing page that doubles as a login portal. The page showcases a large, thematic image representing the site's focus on various cultural elements. Adjacent to the image is the login form, enabling existing users to quickly access their accounts. For newcomers, convenient links to the 'About Us' page and 'Sign Up' form are prominently displayed, inviting them to join the community.

- **About Us:** This page provides insightful information about the Culture Club, its mission, and what new members can expect upon joining. It serves as an introduction to the site's ethos and community spirit.

- **Sign Up:** A welcoming space for new users, the 'Join Us' page offers an easy and straightforward sign-up process, encouraging cultural enthusiasts to become a part of the vibrant Culture Club community.

#### After User Logs In:

Post-login, users gain access to a range of interactive and personalized features:

- **Home Page (Inside the Culture Club):** The heart of the site, the home page presents the latest posts. Users can enjoy a broad overview of all posts or filter content by categories using the category selection buttons. Each post is displayed as an engaging card, featuring a clickable image (to the full post view), the title, a brief excerpt, author's name, and the number of likes.

- **Full Blog Post View:** Each blog post can be viewed in its entirety on a dedicated page. This full view not only presents the complete content of the post, including images and detailed text, but also fosters user interaction and community engagement. Below each post, a comment section allows users to share their thoughts, engage in discussions, and connect with others. The author's name is linked to their user profile. Similarly, every user who comments has a clickable name that directs to their profile, enabling a deeper exploration of the community and fostering connections among users with similar interests.

- **Create New Post:** A creative space where users can share their cultural insights. This form allows for the inclusion of relevant images, titles, excerpts, detailed blog content, release year (for movies, for instance), media category, and reference URLs. New posts, once published, are prominently displayed on the home page.

- **My Posts:** A personalized collection of the user's blog posts. This page not only showcases their contributions but also offers 'Edit' and 'Delete' options for each post, giving users full control over their content.

- **Bookmarked:** A curated list of the user's bookmarked posts, allowing for quick access to favorite articles and discussions. Users can easily bookmark or remove bookmarks as they navigate through the site.

#### Profile Navigation:

Accessing the profile icon in the navigation bar opens up more user-specific features:

- **Profile Page:** A personal showcase featuring the user's profile picture, bio, country of origin, and their 'Top Selections' in various cultural categories like 'Movies', 'Series', 'Music Albums', etc. This page is a window into each user's unique tastes and interests.

- **Edit Profile Page:** Users can update their profile details, ensuring their personal page reflects their evolving preferences and experiences.

- **Manage Account:** A crucial feature for account management, this page allows users to delete their account. It includes clear warnings about the permanence of this action and requires confirmation to proceed, ensuring users make informed decisions.

- **Log Out:** A simple yet secure logout process. Users are prompted to confirm their intention to log out, safeguarding their account access. Once logged out they get redirected to the log in landing page.

# Methodology

The Culture Club project follows a methodology inspired by agile principles, fostering collaboration, flexibility, and gradual development. The outlined approach has guided the project's evolution:

### Agile Project Management with GitHub Projects
To streamline project management, GitHub Projects is employed as a central hub. User stories and tasks are structured as GitHub issues, creating an organized workflow. The GitHub project board serves as a visual representation, tracking progress effectively.

### User Stories as GitHub Issues
Transforming user stories into GitHub issues captures user-centric functionalities. These issues interlink with respective user stories, simplifying access to criteria, tasks, and comments.

### Bug Tracking for Seamless Development
Bugs uncovered during development are documented as GitHub issues, offering insights into each bug's characteristics, impact, and reproduction steps. By hyperlinking these issues in README.md, users can stay updated on bug resolutions and contribute insights.

### Iterative Development Approach
The Culture Club project adheres to an iterative development approach, facilitating continuous enhancements within a predefined timeline. Despite its condensed schedule, the project accommodates future iterations and expansions.

### Future Backlog and Progress
The project board efficiently manages user stories, with the "Not started" column representing upcoming iterations. This backlog previews user stories set for subsequent development phases.

Emphasizing that the project timeline is expedited, the iterative approach maintains adaptability, enabling ongoing refinements and improvements aligned with evolving user needs.

# Deployment

### App Deployment
For deploying Your app, Heroku is used. Follow these steps:

 **Create a New App:**
   - Create a new app on Heroku dashboard.

 **Configure Settings:**
   - Navigate to "Settings" in new app.

 **Config Vars Setup:**
   - In "Config Vars," add `PORT` as the key and `8000` as its value.

 **Add PostgreSQL Database:**
   - Choose PostgreSQL as database.

        Example "ElephantSQL" was used in this project

 **Configure DATABASE_URL:**
   - In "Config Vars," add `DATABASE_URL` and copy the URL from PostgreSQL dashboard.

     Note: If using ElephantSQL as PostgreSQL provider, you can use the URL provided by ElephantSQL.

 **Environment Variable Setup:**
   - Create a new file in workspace called `env.py`.
   - Import the `os` library and set the environment variable for `DATABASE_URL` to the Heroku address (or ElephantSQL URL)
   - Add a secret key using `os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "your secret key here"`.

 **Heroku Config Vars:**
   - Add the secret key to the Heroku app's config vars in the settings.

 **Django Settings:**
   - In `settings.py` of Django app, import `Path` from `pathlib`, `os`, and `dj_database_url`.
   - Add `if os.path.isfile("env.py"): import env` to the file.
   - Replace the SECRET_KEY with `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')`.
   - Replace the database section with `DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))}`.

 **Migrate Models:**
   - In workspace terminal, migrate the models to the new database connection.

### Cloudinary
To integrate Cloudinary into project, follow these steps:

 **Cloudinary Account:**
   - Log in to Cloudinary account or create one.

 **Copy CLOUDINARY_URL:**
   - Copy `CLOUDINARY_URL`.

 **Environment Variable Setup:**
   - In `env.py`, add `os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "add cloudinary_url here"`.

 **Heroku Config Vars:**
   - In Heroku settings, add `CLOUDINARY_URL` to config vars.

 **Django Settings:**
   - In `INSTALLED_APPS`, add `cloudinary_storage`, `Django.contrib.staticfiles`, and `cloudinary` in this order.
   - Configure static file settings in `settings.py`: URL, storage path, directory path, root path, media URL, and default file storage.

 **Templates Directory Link:**
   - Link the file to the templates directory in Heroku with `TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')`.

 **Change Templates Directory:**
   - Change the templates directory to `TEMPLATES_DIR - 'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR]`.

 **Additional Folders:**
   - Create three new folders: `media`, `static`, and `templates`.

 **Procfile Creation:**
   - Create a `Procfile`.
   - Add the following line inside the Procfile: `web: gunicorn project_name_here.wsgi`.

 **Push Changes:**
    - Push all changes to GitHub.

 **Manual Deployment:**
    - In the Heroku deployment tab, deploy to Heroku manually the first time and closely monitor the process.
    - Once successful, set up automatic deployments.

### Version Control
To manage version control and push code to the main repository on GitHub using GitPod, follow these steps:

 **Add Changes:**
   - In the GitPod terminal, use the command `git add .` to stage changes.

 **Commit Changes:**
   - Commit changes with a descriptive comment using the command:
     ```
     git commit -m "Push comment here"
     ```

 **Push to GitHub:**
   - Push the updates to the repository on GitHub with the command:
     ```
     git push
     ```


 **Migrate Models:**
    - In the terminal, migrate the models to the new database connection.

### Forking the Repository:

By forking the GitHub Repository, can create a copy of the original repository without affecting the original. Follow these steps:

 **GitHub Account Setup:**
   - Log into GitHub account or create one if you don't have one.

 **Locate the Repository:**
   - Find the repository at https://github.com/DebbieBergstrom/Culture-Club.

 **Fork the Repository:**
   - At the top right of the repository page, click "Fork" to create a copy in your own GitHub repository.

### Clone of the Repository:

Creating a clone allows you to have a local copy of the project. Follow these steps:

 **Repository URL:**
   - Navigate to https://github.com/DebbieBergstrom/Culture-Club.
   - Click the green "Code" button at the top right.

 **Clone the Repository:**
   - Select the "Clone by HTTPS" option and copy the provided URL to the clipboard.

 **Terminal and Git:**
   - Open your code editor or terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
   - Run `git clone` followed by the copied URL.
   - Press enter, and Git will clone the repository to your local machine.


To fork the repository, follow these steps:

1. Go to the GitHub repository.
2. Click on the Fork button in the upper right-hand corner.
3. Wait for the forking process to complete. Once done, you will have a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

To clone the repository, follow these steps:

1. Go to the GitHub repository.
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it.
3. Select your preferred method for cloning: HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI, and click the copy button to copy the repository URL to your clipboard.
4. Open Git Bash (or your preferred terminal).
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be created.
6. Type the command `git clone` followed by the URL you copied in step 3. The command should look like this: `git clone https://github.com/DebbieBergstrom/Culture-Club`.
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.
