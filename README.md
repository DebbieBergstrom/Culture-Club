# Methodology

The Culture Club project follows a methodology inspired by agile principles, fostering collaboration, flexibility, and gradual development. The outlined approach has guided the project's evolution:

### Agile Project Management with GitHub Projects
To streamline project management, GitHub Projects is employed as a central hub. User stories and tasks are structured as GitHub issues, creating an organized workflow. The GitHub project board serves as a visual representation, tracking progress effectively.

### User Stories as GitHub Issues
Transforming user stories into GitHub issues captures user-centric functionalities. These issues interlink with respective user stories, simplifying access to criteria, tasks, and discussions.

### Bug Tracking for Seamless Development
Bugs uncovered during development are documented as GitHub issues, offering insights into each bug's characteristics, impact, and reproduction steps. By hyperlinking these issues in README.md, users can stay updated on bug resolutions and contribute insights.

### Iterative Development Approach
The Culture Club project adheres to an iterative development approach, facilitating continuous enhancements within a predefined timeline. Despite its condensed schedule, the project accommodates future iterations and expansions.

### Future Backlog and Progress
The project board efficiently manages user stories, with the "Not started" column representing upcoming iterations. This backlog previews user stories set for subsequent development phases.

Emphasizing that the project timeline is expedited, the iterative approach maintains adaptability, enabling ongoing refinements and improvements aligned with evolving user needs.

**Labels and User Story Distribution (MoSCoW):**

- **Must-Have:** example 10/15
- **Should-Have:** 
- **Could-Have:** 
- **Wont-Have:**
- **Task:** 

For a comprehensive view of the project's trajectory, user stories, and bug tracking, explore the [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/DebbieBergstrom/URLPATH).

# Testing

The Culture Club website went through a comprehensive testing process to guarantee its functionality, accessibility, and performance. This included checking the code, such as code validation, accessibility assessment, performance testing, cross-device testing, verification of browser compatibility, assessment of user stories, and the integration of user feedback to enhance the overall user experience.

All testing, including both manual and automated testing, was carried out and documented in [Testing.md](TESTING.md).

# Deployment

### App Deployment
For deploying Your app, Heroku is used. Follow these steps:

 **Create a New App:**
   - Create a new app on Heroku dashboard.

 **Configure Settings:**
   - Navigate to "Settings" in new app.

 **Config Vars Setup:**
   - In "Config Vars," add `PORT` as the key and `8000` as its value.

 **Add PostgreSQL Database:**
   - Choose PostgreSQL as database.

        Example "ElephantSQL" was used in this project

 **Configure DATABASE_URL:**
   - In "Config Vars," add `DATABASE_URL` and copy the URL from PostgreSQL dashboard.

     Note: If using ElephantSQL as PostgreSQL provider, you can use the URL provided by ElephantSQL.

 **Environment Variable Setup:**
   - Create a new file in workspace called `env.py`.
   - Import the `os` library and set the environment variable for `DATABASE_URL` to the Heroku address (or ElephantSQL URL)
   - Add a secret key using `os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "your secret key here"`.

 **Heroku Config Vars:**
   - Add the secret key to the Heroku app's config vars in the settings.

 **Django Settings:**
   - In `settings.py` of Django app, import `Path` from `pathlib`, `os`, and `dj_database_url`.
   - Add `if os.path.isfile("env.py"): import env` to the file.
   - Replace the SECRET_KEY with `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')`.
   - Replace the database section with `DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))}`.

 **Migrate Models:**
   - In workspace terminal, migrate the models to the new database connection.

### Cloudinary
To integrate Cloudinary into project, follow these steps:

 **Cloudinary Account:**
   - Log in to Cloudinary account or create one.

 **Copy CLOUDINARY_URL:**
   - Copy `CLOUDINARY_URL`.

 **Environment Variable Setup:**
   - In `env.py`, add `os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "add cloudinary_url here"`.

 **Heroku Config Vars:**
   - In Heroku settings, add `CLOUDINARY_URL` to config vars.

 **Django Settings:**
   - In `INSTALLED_APPS`, add `cloudinary_storage`, `Django.contrib.staticfiles`, and `cloudinary` in this order.
   - Configure static file settings in `settings.py`: URL, storage path, directory path, root path, media URL, and default file storage.

 **Templates Directory Link:**
   - Link the file to the templates directory in Heroku with `TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')`.

 **Change Templates Directory:**
   - Change the templates directory to `TEMPLATES_DIR - 'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR]`.

 **Additional Folders:**
   - Create three new folders: `media`, `static`, and `templates`.

 **Procfile Creation:**
   - Create a `Procfile`.
   - Add the following line inside the Procfile: `web: gunicorn project_name_here.wsgi`.

 **Push Changes:**
    - Push all changes to GitHub.

 **Manual Deployment:**
    - In the Heroku deployment tab, deploy to Heroku manually the first time and closely monitor the process.
    - Once successful, set up automatic deployments.

### Version Control
To manage version control and push code to the main repository on GitHub using GitPod, follow these steps:

 **Add Changes:**
   - In the GitPod terminal, use the command `git add .` to stage changes.

 **Commit Changes:**
   - Commit changes with a descriptive comment using the command:
     ```
     git commit -m "Push comment here"
     ```

 **Push to GitHub:**
   - Push the updates to the repository on GitHub with the command:
     ```
     git push
     ```


 **Migrate Models:**
    - In the terminal, migrate the models to the new database connection.

### Forking the Repository:

By forking the GitHub Repository, can create a copy of the original repository without affecting the original. Follow these steps:

 **GitHub Account Setup:**
   - Log into GitHub account or create one if you don't have one.

 **Locate the Repository:**
   - Find the repository at [https://URLPATH).

 **Fork the Repository:**
   - At the top right of the repository page, click "Fork" to create a copy in your own GitHub repository.

### Clone of the Repository:

Creating a clone allows you to have a local copy of the project. Follow these steps:

 **Repository URL:**
   - Navigate to [https://URLPATH).
   - Click the green "Code" button at the top right.

 **Clone the Repository:**
   - Select the "Clone by HTTPS" option and copy the provided URL to the clipboard.
